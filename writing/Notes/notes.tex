\section{Introduction}


The N-Body technique has been used for decades to simulate the Universe so we can compare theory with observations. This technique uses ``particles'' or ``bodies'' to sample phase space, and as gravity operates over infinite distance it is necessary to consider all pair-wise interactions which makes a naive implementation $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.
It is clear that this does not scale particularly well with large particle counts.

One common approach is to decompose the particles into a tree structure and multipole expansions of the particles in each tree cell to approximate the forces. This reduces the complexity of the algorithm to $\mathcal{O}(n\log{}n)$. More recently the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) has gained wider option primarily due to the extremely large sizes of modern simulations. This technique further reduces the complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n)$!

The computational effort required in modern N-Body simulations can thus be split into three categories:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Load Balancing:} Distribute particles equally among nodes with regards to memory.
	\item \textbf{Tree Building:} Build tree on each node for accelerated force calculation and integration.
	\item \textbf{Force calculation and integration:} Calculate forces between particles and apply them.
\end{itemize}

Before the implementation of FMM into codes, and particularly before the era of modern accelerated computing (e.g., SIMD vectorization and GPU computing) the forces calculations dominated the computational cost. In more recent simulations, each category is about one third of the total calculation time\cite{2017ComAC...4....2P}. This makes the tree building and load balancing subjects to great performance gains, since GPU acceleration is usually not exploited. 

This project proposes to implement ORB with the CUDA API to accelerate load balancing.

\section{ORB Algorithm}


%https://de.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package
%https://texample.net/tikz/examples/
The ORB Algorithm can be used to partition a multi dimensional domain into subdomains based on spatial proximity. The advantage of subdividing the domain into smaller subdomains is two folds:

\begin{itemize}
	\item For simulation code and more specifically for the Fast Multipole Method these domains can be leveraged to greatly accelerate the simulation time. 
	\item The workload can be equally distributed among nodes and processors in large computing systems.
\end{itemize} 


The general idea of the ORB algorithm is to split a $k$ dimensional domain containing $N$ particles into $np$ subdomains using a recursive procedure. This can be repeated until the number of smallest subdomains is equal to the total count of processors or nodes. The final goal is an equal distribution of the workload and data, thus the subdomain sizes should be chosen such that the number of particles is equal among nodes / processors.

\subsection{Memory and Workload Balancing}
For the ORB algorithms itself, the relation between the number of processors and the workload holds steady. But for the simulation certain particles require more timesteps, thus more computational effort, than others. This is mostly due to higher accelerations and greater proximity to strong gravitational influences. This in turn requires a higher accuracy to mitigate errors. If we try to incorporate these effects, we will end up with partitions which are more equal in terms of workload, but less equal in terms of memory. 

\vspace{5mm}
If we consider a system with various nodes, the approach is usually to distribute 
Unequal balancing of the memory in favor of a more equal balance in terms of workload, will results in 
 For the sake of simplicity, we will assume it is sensible to simply partition the domain into equally sized subdomains.

TODO: extend reasoning

\subsection{ORB for power of twos}

Let us first make the assumption that $np$ is a power of two. In this case we can search for a cut such that 50\% of the particles are on the left side and likewise on the right side of the cut. The position of the cut can be found in $O(log(N))$ using a binary search. We can introduce an even tighter bound when assuming each particle is being stored as a 32 bit precision number. In this case we have reached the maximum precision after $O(32)$ iterations. After such a cut has been found, we can create two new subdomains and recursively apply the algorithm on both of tem until we have reached the desired number of subdomains $np$.

For a clearer terminology, we will from now on refer to a domain as a cell. Furthermore the subdomain of a domain is the child cell of a cell, and likewise we also have the concept of a parent cell.

\vspace{5mm}

When each cell keeps track of its child cells, we have built a tree datastructure. For instance for our simple domain composition of depth 3 from Figure \ref{fig:balorb} we end up with structure as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:baltree} In this tree each cell represents a node, the root node is the cell which encompasses the entire space and particles and finally its leaves can be assigned to a processor / node. Note that the tree is not balanced, but each node has either two children or is a leaf.

\subsection{ORB in the general case}

Let us now consider the general case where $np$ can be any integer number. 

In this case we chose the cut such that we have 50\% of particles to the left and right. But we define the number of particles on the left side by $l = \left \lceil{\frac{np}{2}}\right \rceil$. Consequently the number of particles on the right are $r = np - l$. In the next iteration of the recursion, the left child cell will set $np = l$ and the right side $np = r$. This ensures that we end up with the right number of domains.

\subsection{Pseudocode}

We always choose the dimension which is the biggest to perform the next cut. This has the advantage of yielding domains which are of a shape closely approximating a square. Square domains are of great importance for the performance and efficiency of the FFM (Fast Multipole Method).

\section{Theoretical analysis of ORB speedup by GPU acceleration}

In order to have a broad idea what speedup we can expect by implementing a GPU version, we first need to understand which parts of the code are suited to be done on the GPU. The GPU profits from a highly parallelized architecture, this means that it performs exceptionally when vectorization can be applied to large set of values. But the GPU has another strength over the CPU, which may be lesser known. The memory bandwidth between the GPU and its memory is much greater than the memory bandwidth between the CPU and GPU. Therefore we omit speedups which are introduced by parallelizing calculations and instead focus on the memory access overheads.

\subsection{Assumptions} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	One particle requires 32 bytes of storage. Where the XYZ coordinates require $4\times3 = 12$ bytes of storage, the rest is used for additional information.
	
	\item
	A single iteration of the binary cut algorithm requires $32 \times N$ operations.
	
	\item 
	All particles are assumed to be stored in the CPU memory initially.
	
	\item
	We perform the analysis on one billion particles. This means we need 32 GB storage for all the particles and 12 GB for only the XYZ positions. This translates to $10^9 \times 4 bytes = 4 GB$, assuming floating point precision. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Runtime estimations}

When executing the algorithm on the CPU, for a single iteration of the binary cut algorithm we perform a scan over an axis of all particle positions. Due to the nature of the datastructure we can usually not  TODO 

TODO: mention somewhere only cut part of algorithm is parallelized

\subsubsection{Naive implemtation}

To analyze the runtime for the CPU we are using Equation \ref{eq:cpu}. The constant 32 represents the iterations which are necessary to find a cut. To find a cut we need to sweep 32 times over the entire array of particles, thus we multiply it by the data size $s$ divided by the cpu memory bandwidth denoted as $B_{CPU}$.

\begin{center}
	\begin{equation}
			32 \times \frac{ s }{B_{CPU}} = t
			\label{eq:cpu}
	\end{equation}
\end{center}


The Equation \ref{eq:gpu} for the GPU is similar, the only difference being that we use the GPU memory bandwidth $B_{GPU}$ instead of the CPU bandwidth. Furthermore we have to consider the time it takes to send the data from the CPU to the GPU. This adds the terms size divided by CPU to GPU memory bandwidth denoted as $I$.

 TODO: Here we also need to consider reading data once in CPU before sending it to the GPU?
 


\begin{center}
	\begin{equation}
		32 \times \frac{s}{B_{GPU}} + \frac{s}{I} = t
		\label{eq:gpu}
	\end{equation}
\end{center}


\subsubsection{Improved implementation}

Let us now consider an alternative way of computing binary cuts. We will build part of the tree on the GPU itself. This will allow us to reduce the very costly overheads imposed by transfering data from the CPU to the GPU. The maximum number of cuts we can perform is 32. After 32 cuts we have $2^{32}$ domains, and have reached the precision limit of the floating point positions.


\begin{center}
	\begin{equation}
		32 \times 32 \times \frac{s}{B_{CPU}} =t
	\end{equation}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
	\begin{equation}
		32 \times 32 \times \frac{s}{B_{CPU}} + \frac{s}{32 GB/s} + \frac{8 GB}{32 GB/s} = 6 s
	\end{equation}
\end{center}


\subsection{Datapoints of supercomputers}

We will compare the performance with the datapoints of Piz Daint, Summit and Alps which is a part of Eiger. We choose Piz Daint because we have the possibility to test the Code on its systems. We choose Eiger because we can also access its systems and it will give us a good reference values, due to it being a non hybrid supercomputer, meaning the nodes to not have GPU. Finally we analyze its performance on Summit, as its at the time of writing this thesis, one of the most capable supercomputers in the world.

On the CPU this results in a memory access time of 
\begin{center}
	$32 \times \frac{ 4 GB}{68 GB/s} = 1.8 s$

If we do the same on the GPU we get an access time of:
\begin{center}
	$32 \times \frac{4 GB}{732 GB/s} + \frac{4 GB}{32 GB/s} = 0.3 s$ 
\end{center}

This results in a theoretical speedup of:

\begin{center}
	$\frac{1.8}{0.3} = 6$
\end{center}


\begin{center}
	$32 \times 32 \times \frac{ 4 GB}{68 GB/s} = 60.2 s$ 
\end{center}

\begin{center}
	$32 \times 32 \times \frac{4 GB}{732 GB/s} + \frac{12 GB}{32 GB/s} + \frac{4 GB}{32 GB/s} = 6 s$

\subsection{Data-structure}

The data-structure which stores the entire three needs to have following properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item store domain information and provide access to left and right child cells
	\item Allow highly unbalanced trees
\end{itemize}

The most naive approach is to use a struct for each cell which stores information about the domain and keeps a pointer to the left and right cell. However since we in high performance systems, synchronizing pointers can be a bit of hassle, furthermore PKDGrav implements distributed arrays. Thus we can store all domain information in an array and simply keep track of the indices of its child cells. This can even be reduced further, since the right child cell is being created by the same process as the left child was. Thus we can assign the information about the right child in the positions left + 1 and only keep track of the index of the left child.

Since we are building a tree and we 


PkdGrav uses concept of distributed arrays, makes use of logical indexed, thus we do not use pointers. Pointers also take up more memory. 

Standard array are not high performance. Has an overhead. Standard vector is not too bad. Blitz arrays. 
ARgue about vector, array std::vector

\subsection{CPU parallelization of ORB}

To parallelize the ORB algorithms, we first need to think about which parts of the algorithm can be parallelized and yield in a performance improvement. The most obvious choice for parallelization is the counting part. In this case the main thread will send a split and the array of particles is distributed among all the processy
Use OpenMPI / MPich, btoh same standard
Reshuffling of arrays cannot be done in place.

There are several variants on how to parallelize the CPU parallelized version of the ORB. Since it is a recursive algorithm
