	and kD-Trees",
	author =     "G\"{u}nther Voglsam",
	year =       "2013",
	abstract =   "In computer graphics, ray tracing is a well-known image
	generation algorithm which exists since the late 1970s. Ray
	tracing is typically known as an offline algorithm, which
	means that the image generation process takes several
	seconds to minutes or even hours or days.  In this thesis I
	present a ray tracer which runs in real-time. Real-time in
	terms of computer graphics means that 60 or more images per
	second (frames per second, FPS) are created. To achieve such
	frame rates, the ray tracer runs completely on the graphics
	card (GPU). This is possible by making use of Nvidia’s
	CUDA -API. With CUDA, it is possible to program the
	processor of a graphics card similar to a processor of a
	CPU. This way, the computational power of a graphics card
	can be fully utilized. A crucial part of any ray tracer is
	the acceleration data structure (ADS) used. The ADS is
	needed to efficiently search in geometric space. In this
	thesis, two variants of so called kD-Trees have been
	implemented. A kD-Tree is a binary tree, which divides at
	each node a given geometric space into two halves using an
	axis aligned splitting plane. Furthermore, a CUDA library
	for the rendering engine Aardvark, which is the in-house
	rendering engine at the VRVis Research Center, was developed
	to access CUDA functionality from within Aardvark in an easy
	and convenient way.  The ray tracer is part of a current
	software project called “HILITE” at the VRVis Research
	Center.",
